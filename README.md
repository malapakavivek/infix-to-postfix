This program helps to convert an infix expression to a postfix expression 

An infix expression is something which has the operator in between the operands and it can be easily read by us for example: A+B; AX*BY/CZ

A postfix expression contains the operands first followed by the operator for example: AB+; *AX/BYCZ
